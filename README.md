# ttkGUIManager
## TTK widget manager for Python3

One day I got tired of going through stacks of TkInter commands to create a simple GUI for my Python tinkering,
so I decided to create a "shortcut" library for this exactly purpose.

The main idea is, that with one simple command one can create a whole set of GUI elements without worry about how to stick them together.
For example - creating a listbox with _create_listbox()_ will create and return a listbox, complete with scroll and a few commands for retrieving and inserting the data into said listbox.

There is no documentation as such yet, one will be developed soon.
Project is by no mean completed, there's still room for improvement and/or expansion, which may happen some time in the future.
Feel free to add to it, should you want to.

-----

**GUIManager.py** -- this is the main file one wants to import into his project. It assumes that TkInter for Python is already installed.

**one.py** -- this is the example file (I should probably change the file name...) to demonstrate what can be done with this very simplified syntax. Running this will create a simple window with a few gadgets.

Hope you'll like it!
